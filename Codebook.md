This code book describes each variable and its values in the tidy data set.


## Study Design
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Six activities were performed (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying) while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 


## Code Book Variables
### Column 1: Subject
Subjects labeled 1-30.

### Column 2: Activity 
Activities include walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying.

### Columns 3-81: Measurements
Measurements (in Hz) were taken for the following categories in 3-axial signals in the X, Y, and Z directions, where t=time, f=frequency domain signals, Acc=accelerometer, Gyro=gyroscope, Mag=magnitude:
